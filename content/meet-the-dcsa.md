Hi! I’m Niamh and I’m a third year PhD student at the Department of Chemistry specialising in developing new carbon capture technology. Outside of my PhD, I enjoy socialising at Darbar, reading in the gardens and taking care of my many plant babies. If you have any ideas or questions for the DCSA and/or college, drop me a message so we can chat over a cup of tea/coffee!<br><br>

The President is the representative of the DCSA to College, voicing the opinions of the students to all College members. They coordinate the committee by chairing DCSA Regular Meetings and General Meetings. The President works very closely with the Secretary, Treasurer, and the rest of the committee to ensure work is completed. The President sits on the College Council as a student representative, attends fortnightly Cambridge Students’ Union meetings, and sits on numerous College committees (including Strategic Planning, PREVENT, Health & Safety, and Wine).

        Patrick HAYES<br/>
        <p align="justify">
Patrick is a third year PhD student in Classics, he studies the formation of political borders during the Hellenistic Period. You can find him mulling over all things ancient at Darbar where he regularly pulls pints and is well known for creating a flawless Baby Guinness. He also loves running and reading (although not at the same time - that's difficult!).<br><br>

Darbar is the college bar and is totally run and staffed by Darwin students. The Bar Chair presides over the Bar Committee and the large group of bartenders, and makes sure everyone can enjoy the bar, whilst keeping a safe and welcoming space both for customers and staff. If you have any questions or ideas for making Darbar even better please get in contact with the email above. The Bar Chair is elected by the Bar Committee annually.
