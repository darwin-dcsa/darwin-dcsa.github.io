Her combined interest in Orthopaedic surgery and sports has ultimately led to her growing fascination in young adult hip surgery, specifically athletes returning to play.

She is more than happy to discuss any ideas or suggestions on building on Darwin’s already exciting community!<br><br>

Poppy is usually found at the bar drinking one of their great German beers. Outside of the bar, she is actively involved in rowing and loves grabbing a coffee!<br><br>

Darbar is the college bar and is totally run and staffed by Darwin students. The Bar Chair presides over the Bar Committee and the large group of bartenders, and makes sure everyone can enjoy the bar, whilst keeping a safe and welcoming space both for customers and staff. If you have any questions or ideas for making Darbar even better please get in contact with the email above. The Bar Chair is elected by the Bar Committee rather than being elected by all students.
