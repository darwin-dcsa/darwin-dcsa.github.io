        <p align="justify"> 
Hi, I’m Katie, a Linguistics PhD student specialising in Forensic Phonetics and Queer Linguistics. I’ve moved around for much of my life (so from nowhere in particular) but I currently live in Windsor. When I’m not working on my PhD or doing DCSA related things, you can usually find me singing, listening to music or enjoying a drink with my friends at DarBar. If you’ve got any questions about the DCSA or college, feel free to pop me an email or come and say hi! <br><br>


The President is the representative of the DCSA to College, voicing the opinions of the students to all College members. They coordinate the committee by chairing DCSA Regular Meetings and General Meetings. The President works very closely with the Secretary, Treasurer, and the rest of the committee to ensure work is completed. The President sits on the College Council as a student representative, attends fortnightly Cambridge Students’ Union meetings, and sits on numerous College committees (including Strategic Planning, PREVENT, Health & Safety, and Wine).

Hi, I'm David, and I'm a Physics PhD student from Essex working on defect centres in diamonds- in short, I get to shoot lasers at diamonds. When I’m not stuck in a windowless lab I'm usually playing bass, reading books, or building Lego.<br><br>

The Secretary is the administrator of the committee and the Vice President (chair meetings and run the committee in the absence of the President). They run DCSA elections, take meeting minutes, and ensure that up-to-date records of the DCSA’s affairs are maintained, including policy documents and the DCSA Constitution, Schedule, & Regulations. The Secretary also sits on the Buildings & Grounds and the Darwin College Society Committees; and is in charge of the TV room and its bookings.

Hi there! In my third year of doctoral studies on the undeciphered writing of the Bronze Age in Greece, I am usually to be found working about the parlour or gardens unless I am out on the Cam. An excellent punter, a tolerable student and a dismal musician, beyond enjoying the outdoors I have pretensions at assorted literary and artistic pursuits and am always up for a chat about anything.

The Admiral of the Punts is responsible for all the punt club's vessels, including punts, kayaks, canoe, paddle boards, and associated equipment.

Hi, I’m Seema, a PhD student in Medical Sciences at the CRUK CI, originally from the beautiful island of Mauritius. When I’m not busy with my PhD, I love curling up with a good book, baking, or tending to my ever-growing plant collection  (I’m a proud plant hoarder who refuses to let the occasional plant mishap stop me!).

If you have a disability—whether diagnosed or not, visible or non-visible—and would like to discuss about available resources, support, or navigating life as a student with a disability, or chat about anything else, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’d be happy to assist in any way I can!<br><br>

The Ents Officers coordinate, organise, and promote the Darwin BOPs. They are responsible for the music, decorations, security, and finances. They also work with the Events Officer to host other events throughout the year. Darwin BOPs are known for their vibrant atmosphere and original themes and they always have the most popular Cambridge bands performing.

Hello everybody! I am Siggi, going into my second year studying the environmental impact of the food system and the use of choice architecture interventions to promote sustainable food choices. I am originally from Iceland, but have lived in the UK for most of my adult life, first in London and then for nearly 15 years here in Cambridge.  I have a background in medicine and law, but now devote most of my time and energy towards climate and social justice.
            
Outside of that I can be found running around Cambridge for extensive periods of time for no obvious reason, and also if it is sunny cycling aimlessly around the surrounding countryside. I also regularly attempt something that could generously be described as singing with the Darwin choir. <br><br>

The College Council Reps are elected by the students to represent them in College Council meetings and other college committees.

You’ll likely find me chilling in DarBar with friends so if you have any bar- or adventure-related questions, feel free to come say hi!
<br><br>

DarBar is the college bar and is totally run and staffed by Darwin students. The Bar Chair presides over the Bar Committee and the large group of bartenders, and makes sure everyone can enjoy the bar, whilst keeping a safe and welcoming space both for customers and staff. If you have any questions or ideas for making Darbar even better please get in contact with the email above. The Bar Chair is elected by the Bar Committee annually.
