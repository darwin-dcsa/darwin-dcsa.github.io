Hi, I’m Katie, a Linguistics PhD student specialising in Forensic Phonetics and Queer Linguistics. I’ve moved around for much of my life (so from nowhere in particular) but I currently live in Windsor. When I’m not working on my PhD or doing DCSA related things, you can usually find me singing, listening to music or enjoying a drink with my friends at DarBar. If you’ve got any questions about the DCSA or college, feel free to pop me an email or come and say hi! <br><br>


The President is the representative of the DCSA to College, voicing the opinions of the students to all College members. They coordinate the committee by chairing DCSA Regular Meetings and General Meetings. The President works very closely with the Secretary, Treasurer, and the rest of the committee to ensure work is completed. The President sits on the College Council as a student representative, attends fortnightly Cambridge Students’ Union meetings, and sits on numerous College committees (including Strategic Planning, PREVENT, Health & Safety, and Wine).

The Secretary is the administrator of the committee and the Vice President (chair meetings and run the committee in the absence of the President). They run DCSA elections, take meeting minutes, and ensure that up-to-date records of the DCSA’s affairs are maintained, including policy documents and the DCSA Constitution, Schedule, & Regulations. The Secretary also sits on the Buildings & Grounds and the Darwin College Society Committees; and is in charge of the TV room and its bookings.

Hi there! In my third year of doctoral studies on the undeciphered writing of the Bronze Age in Greece, I am usually to be found working about the parlour or gardens unless I am out on the Cam.

The Ents Officers coordinate, organise, and promote the Darwin BOPs. They are responsible for the music, decorations, security, and finances. They also work with the Events Officer to host other events throughout the year. Darwin BOPs are known for their vibrant atmosphere and original themes and they always have the most popular Cambridge bands performing. Think live music, themes, drinks, DJs, raffles, good vibes and dancing until the early morning... Reach out to them if you have any ideas!

The Environmental & Ethical Affairs Officer is responsible for the coordination and implementation of measures to address environmental and ethical issues, and organises college events promoting awareness of these issues.

Hello everybody! I am Siggi, going into my second year studying the environmental impact of the food system and the use of choice architecture interventions to promote sustainable food choices. I am originally from Iceland, but have lived in the UK for most of my adult life, first in London and then for nearly 15 years here in Cambridge.  I have a background in medicine and law, but now devote most of my time and energy towards climate and social justice.
            
Outside of that I can be found running around Cambridge for extensive periods of time for no obvious reason, and also if it is sunny cycling aimlessly around the surrounding countryside. I also regularly attempt something that could generously be described as singing with the Darwin choir. <br><br>

The College Council Reps are elected by the students to represent them in College Council meetings and other college committees. They also report the business of College Council to the DCSA, and provide feedback to college on student interests. One rep is elected in November, and the other is elected in May.

Hey hey, I’m Aidan! I’m a third-year PhD student in Computer Science, researching the mathematical foundations of computer science (“P vs NP” stuff for those familiar). I grew up in the US and spend much of my free time traveling and trying out new hobbies. Among many others, I’m highly involved in the university’s gymnastics club and yacht sailing club. You’ll likely find me chilling in DarBar with friends so if you have any bar- or adventure-related questions, feel free to come say hi!

DarBar is the college bar and is totally run and staffed by Darwin students. The Bar Chair presides over the Bar Committee and the large group of bartenders, and makes sure everyone can enjoy the bar, whilst keeping a safe and welcoming space both for customers and staff. If you have any questions or ideas for making Darbar even better please get in contact with the email above. The Bar Chair is elected by the Bar Committee annually.
