The six punts - Isabela, Velociraptor, The Beagle, Master Brown, Iguana, and Barnacle - are moored on the part of the river that runs through the college grounds. Punting equipment, the kayaks, canoe, and the paddle boards are stored in the punt house next to the Old Granary.

A quick summary (not comprehensive), you are still expected to read the full Terms and Conditions before signing up!
<ul>
<li>A single outing can last up to 3h, a punt member can either take out 2 single kayaks or paddle boards at any one time or a single punt, canoe, or double kayak. If multiple punts are required or other non-standard bookings please contact the Admiral of the Punts. Families with children under the age of 18 can take out additional kayaks and paddle boards to accomodate all children.</li>
<li>A trip to Grantchester in the punt counts at least as two outings (lasts at least 4h+), thus requiring two bookings. A member can only make a single booking per day, so you will need at least two members/outings to go to Grantchester. You’ll need to be a group of students, in any case, to get the punt over the ramp, and <strong>please make sure to put the mooring pin inside the punt when going down the ramp! We don’t want to have to remove any more bent metal pins.</strong></li>
<li>Student I.D card or any I.D card (Alumni etc), must be left with the porter, once a punt key is taken out of the lodge.</li>
<li>Punts, kayaks, and paddle boards can be taken out from 08.00. Everything must be returned at the very latest 15 minutes before sunset.</li>
<li><strong>NO AFTER DARK PUNTING OR KAYAKING</strong> - only the Admiral can take boats out after dark or give permission to do so.</li>
<li>For students & college members with a raven log: <strong>all bookings need to be entered into the online booking system before the outing starts</strong> - no key can be given out without the online booking or the explicit consent of the Admiral of the Punts. If you don’t have a raven login (as an alumnus) please contact the Alumni Office to make your booking (see website) or request the porters to make the booking for you.</li>
<li>Make sure to check the punt, kayaks, and locks for any damage after the outing and report it both to the porter on duty <strong>AND</strong> the Admiral of the Punts <strong>immediately after returning</strong>. If something is damaged before the outing, go back and inform the porter and write the Admiral.</li>
<li>The person making the booking has to be present at all times during the outing and is responsible for the behaviour of their guests. You are not allowed to make bookings for other persons.</li>
<li>All punt, kayak, paddle board, and canoe hire (including safety equipment) is at the hirer’s own risk. The hirer warrants that both him/herself and all passengers have sufficient training/expertise for the outing (<strong>see the terms and conditions for more details on this!</strong>)</li>
<li>Don't be late when returning - you risk a suspension or fine (and how would you feel if you had to wait for other people to return)</li>
<li>A booking is void if the boat is not taken within 15 minutes of the booked time. After this time the boat will be available to anyone waiting to take the boat until the end of the unused booking, be it one or three hours. The rules about maximum booking length per member still apply.</li>
<li>All our punts carry a maximum of five persons plus one person punting. There is a strict limit on the maximum
occupancy per punt of six persons at any time.</li>
</ul>

<strong>IMPORTANT</strong> - to avoid damage to the boats
<ul>
<li>
Be extra careful with the metal pins when rolling the punt down the rollers on your trip to Grantchester. Make sure to put them inside the punt and do not keep them inside the hole! They might get bent otherwise.
</li>
<li>
Make sure to pull up the rudder on the kayaks when they are out of the water to avoid damage to the rudder. When in the water let the rudder down to make it easier to steer them.
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="bookings">Bookings</h4>

<p align="justify">
Current members of the college, including staff, and alumni can book a single punt for a single outing of up to 3h each day. Punt Club members can book punts for free. Only members can book the canoe or the double kayak or up to two single kayaks or two paddle boards for 3h each day.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Bookings can be made on the day, or up to seven days in advance, and are allocated on a first-come, first-served basis. Each person is permitted to make one reservation per day lasting 3 hours. Weekends are the busiest and booking in advance is strongly recommended. During the week you will usually be able to take a punt out without booking in advance - but it is still recommended to avoid disappointment.
<strong>
For students & college members with a raven login (CRSid): all bookings need to be made before the outing starts via the online booking system.
</strong></p>

<p align="justify">
Trips down The Backs (to Jesus Green and back) typically take between a couple of hours depending on punting experience. Trips to Grantchester and back take 4 to 5 hours on average. As a consequence, the fee for punt trips to Grantchester is equivalent to two outings per punt or you need at least two members to make the journey; The latest time vessels can be taken out is one hour before sunset and
<strong>
all vessels must be returned and moored before sunset.
</strong></p>

<p align="justify">
<strong>For longer trips to Grantchester, if multiple punts are required or other non-standard bookings please contact the Admiral of the Punts.
</strong></p>

<h5>For alumni without a raven log in</h5>
<p align="justify">
Alumni must contact the College Development Office at <a href="alumni.relations@darwin.cam.ac.uk">alumni.relations@darwin.cam.ac.uk</a> who will be able to make the booking in your place. Same-day bookings can be made in person at the porters’ lodge, but we strongly advise you to make the reservation to avoid disappointments.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Chauffeured punt tour services with experienced student punt captains are available. The cost per tour is £30 for punt club members or £40 for non- punt club members and is bookable by current college members and alumni. Please contact the Admiral of the punts by email at least one to two weeks in advance of your desired tour date.

<h4 id="activities-and-events">Activities and Events</h4>

<p align="justify">
Punting has a long tradition in Cambridge and is one of the highlights of what the town has to offer. In addition to being able to take your friends and family out when they visit, membership also gives you the opportunity to sign up to special events such as the annual Punt Race, the outings to the Trinity and St John’s May Ball fireworks at night, and to see King‘s choir‘s singing on the river. We will also chauffeur you to some fancy formals, teach you about bats that live in the area around Grantchester, or just have an enjoyable time in summer on a trip to the Grantchester orchard. Many of the pictures you can see at the top of this section have been taken during some of these events. It’s great fun and a good way to experience some of the unique aspects of Cambridge life.
</p><br>



<h4 id="first-outing">First outing - what you need to know</h4>

<p align="justify">
A small number of life jackets are available if desired and can be found in the same cupboards as the cushions (left side of the kayak house) and on the hangers. You are required to use them when using the kayaks and canoe.
</p><br>

<strong>Where is the equipment?</strong>
<p align="justify">
All equipment (life jackets, punt cushions, punt poles, spare paddle in case you drop the pole (more useful than you think) can be found in our new kayak house, just next to the Old Granary.
</p>
<a href="{{site.baseurl | absolute_url}}/images/puntshow/KayakHouseLocation.png"><img src="{{site.baseurl | absolute_url}}/images/puntshow/KayakHouseLocation.png" alt="[Kayak House Location]" width="300px"/></a>
<br>

<strong>How to lock a punt?</strong>
<p align="justify">
This is a tricky one. <a href="{{site.baseurl | absolute_url}}/documents/PuntClub-Notices.pdf">This document</a> has some information on how to do it. Punts need to be moored at both ends. Do NOT chain one punt to another punt – this creates problems when someone tries to take that punt out. Wrap the chain around the post as often as possible to restrict the movement of the locked-up punts against the concrete walls. But make sure not to lock them too rigidly, so the next person can still use them with ease, even if they are not as strong as you.
</p><br>

<strong>What is bailing?</strong>
<p align="justify">
If you are using the punts after a period of rain, keep in mind that they are likely to contain water! There should be a bucket or bailer at the quay to bail out the water (looks like a blue dustpan). Don't take the bailer with you on the river!
</p><br>

<strong>What if I am late?</strong>
<p align="justify">
Always try to keep to the allotted time. Late-comers risk suspension from the Punt Club. This is particularly important in the evening, never arrive back after dark. In case you are more than 15min late, please make sure to call and inform the Porters’ Lodge at 01223 335660.
</p><br>

<strong>What to do before returning the keys?</strong>
<p align="justify">
Make sure the punts are properly locked. Keep the punts tidy and take any rubbish with you. Return all equipment to where you got it from. If something gets damaged or lost during an outing, report it to the Porter on duty <strong>AND</strong> the Admiral of the Punts as soon as possible. This allows people with later reservations to be notified if there is a problem and will save you a lot of trouble.
</p><br>

<strong>How to steer a punt?</strong>
<p align="justify">
We have a complete <a href="{{site.baseurl | absolute_url}}/documents/PuntGuide.pdf">guide</a> on the topic, but then the best way of learning is probably by doing. The club runs free punting lessons throughout Freshers’ Fortnight at the start of the academic year and these are the best opportunity to learn the basics of punting on the Cam.
We might also offer lessons at other times of the year if there is sufficient demand, so please contact the Admiral of the Punts if you are interested.
</p><br>

<strong>How to make a booking?</strong>
<p align="justify">
To book, log in to the portal to see the availability of the vessels. To make a booking, click on an available time slot. The ‘Create a new reservation’ page will then open. Enter your chosen time, under name of booking enter your full name and CRSID eg John Doe (jd42), then ‘Create’. The booking should then appear under the schedule, payment (in case of single outing, we accept only cashless payments) must be made when you arrive at the porter’s lodge to pick up the keys at the start of the booking.
</p><br>


<h4 id="terms-and-conditions">TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF HIRE</h4>

<p align="justify">
Terms and Conditions are <a href="{{site.baseurl | absolute_url}}/documents/PuntClub-TandC.pdf">available online</a>. In addition, you can get the printed version in the Porters' Lodge. Please contact the Admiral of the Punts if you have difficulties accessing the Terms and Conditions.
