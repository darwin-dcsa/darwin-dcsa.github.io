Having BEEn lured in by the sweet idea  of collecting our very own honey, the  Darwin College Beekeeping Association  started our very own DarHives in the  Darwin Garden. We learn about and  discuss all aspects of beekeeping, but  promise not to drone on about it, and  welcome new members at any experience level as long as you have a high  threshold for bee puns. So, if you are an eco-warrior keen to join the fight against our declining pollinators or just looking for an exciting new hobby, email or join us on a hive visit to find out what all the buzz is about!

<!-- Boat Club -->
<details align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
  <summary><b>Boat Club </b></summary>

<!-- NB: insert image -->

Darwin   College   Boat   Club   (DCBC)   is   the   largest    society    in    Darwin,    dedicated    to    all  things  rowing!  We  are  one  of  the  most  successful graduate boat clubs in Cambridge - just check out the blades in the bar for our previous   accomplishments!   We   are,   above   all,  a  friendly,  social,  and  welcoming  family.  Rowing   is   a   Cambridge   tradition,   and   it   is  almost  impossible  to  avoid  at  least  one  conversation about it during your time here. At  DCBC,  we  believe  that  everyone  should  have a go, and encourage anyone to come try out,  at  least  so  you  can  decipher  the  jargon  of   the   sport!   We   train   year-round   (winter   and  summer)  and  participate  in  numerous  races   both   in   Cambridge   and   outside   of   Cambridge. 
<br><br>
In   August   2024,   Darwin   was   invited   to   compete at an international Regatta in South Korea alongside world leading rowing teams. The   main   events   in   our   calendar   include   Lent (in March) and May (in June - don’t ask) Bumps.  May  Bumps  is  one  of  the  highest-profile  events  in  the  Cambridge  calendar,  with  thousands  of  people  lining  the  banks  over 4 afternoons to watch boats speed down the Cam, attempting to physically crash into one  another  (a  Bump),  while  avoiding  being  hit  by  the  crew  behind  (getting  bumped).  If  you’re not in a boat, you can get the second most enjoyment out of the days by sitting on the  banks  with  your  refreshments  of  choice,  and cheering Darwin to victory! 
<br><br>
We  are  fortunate  enough  to  enter  multiple  boats   into   each   Bumps   race,   so   join   up   to   experience   the   carnage   first-hand!   We   welcome  all  levels  of  rowing  -  from  those  who  don’t  know  what  a  boat  looks  like  or  have  never  used  a  rowing  machine  (erg),  to  future   Olympic   hopefuls,   and   anything   in   between.  We  hold  taster sessions for both rowers and coxes (person in the front  of the boat making the rowing  calls and steering the boat). Whichever you feel suits you, you’ll get full coaching and training by our senior club members and experienced coaches. 
<br><br>
Try a few water sessions (outings) at the beginning of Michaelmas, and with the other novice rowers, you’ll slowly become unstoppable forces of nature, ready to slay the competition out on the river. There are plenty of opportunities for novices to take part in racing in Michaelmas term where you will have the chance to dress-up and race against other colleges. Novice races are  fun and light-hearted, culminating the term with the not-to-be-missed Boat Club Dinner, a chance to regale the Club with your war stories from the term, and just blow off some steam. Rowing is teamwork at its peak. From our strong tan lines in the summer, our matching kit (free speed), the laughs, the sweat, and the shared exquisite  pain, you will come away with some of the closest Darwin  friendships and bonds that will be  everlasting. 
<br><br>
Come and chat to us to find out more at the Fresher’s  Sports  and  Societies  Fair,  and  even  get started and have a go on the erg!

<!-- NB: insert image -->

In 2021, the College has relaunched the college choir, meeting regularly each Tuesday at 1800 in the Bradfield Room. Our new  director, Francis  Knights, has put together a  wonderful  programme of very  accesible English Church Music spanning 900 years  and including pieces by Tallis,  Purcell and Charles Wood, and we would love more singers to join us! The choir is run by the college and not through the DCSA.The choir is open to individuals of all abilities and from throughout the Cambridge     community and the music is VERY accessible. You don't have to be a Darwin  member, so spouses, significant others, partners, and friends are all welcome. Our rehearsals are fun, rewarding, and take place in a very friendly, welcoming environment. Do come along to de-stress from the pressures of work and help support our emerging musical community.

We are a group of climbers that simply just want to go climbing. Since there aren't many rocks around we usually meet for an indoor bouldering session at one of the two gyms in town - Rainbow Rocket (RR) or Kelsey Kerridge (KK). We also make the occasional outdoor trip further north or abroad when the weather/season permits. We organise everything over Whatsapp or or via our mailing list. We have bouldering mats, a trad rack, lots of quickdraws, a few spare harnesses, ropes, and belay devices which you can borrow for trips (indoor or outdoor).

Darwin College Cricket Club (DC3) is a friendly and welcoming sports club whose primary focus is not about winning, but on  making sure that as many Darwinians as possible are introduced to the sport, and get a chance to play it competitively in the  Cuppers and the MCR league. DC3 has a history of being as old as the college  itself, although the club was inactive during some intervals. We welcome players of all abilities, from absolute novices to seasoned veterans. DC3 also organises entertainment and fun activities throughout the year including a termly traditional cricket tea with scones, jam & cream. If you are keen to know more about cricket at Darwin (or want to settle the scone-rivalry), please come and join us!

Drink and Draw is a casual arts and crafts society of the college. Everybody is welcomed, especially those traumatised by school art classes. We mostly meet up in DarBar to doodle and gossip together, but we also organise occasional day-time workshops. The point is to enjoy the process and do something with our hands after stressful days at labs/libraries/behind monitors. Artistic worth and ambition is passively discouraged, but tolerated. Normally we would meet in Darbar between 9pm and 12pm every Wednesday, but until we can meet indoors again, we will be bringing our drinks and art supplies to the Darwin gardens or make trips out around Cambridge - follow our Facebook page for updates (“DarwinDrinkAndDraw”) or email us.

The beautiful game comes to Darwin!
<br><br>
Join Chrisopher Bower and his merry band of ballers for another season of the irresistible odyssey that is the Cambridge College football league. Whether you would like to train casually, dive into two footers on the medieval battlefields otherwise known as JCR playing fields, or even brandish some yellow cards under maverick interpretations of the Football Association’s Laws of the Game, Darwin F.C. will have something for you.
<br><br>
With (sporadically) floodlit facilities to rival St. Georges Park, training takes place on Wednesday’s from 8pm-10pm at Cambridge’s finest footballing campus - the CASS leisure center - a momentary cycle from the main college site. League AND cup matches are 11 a side and take place at weekends, normally followed by socials consisting of the watery nectar provided by the Darwin Bar.
<br><br>
Please don’t be shy, all abilities are welcome (some of the starting 11 are testament to the idea that you don’t need to be technically gifted to play for DFC…)!
<br><br>
Email Captain Chris (cab237) with Vice Captain/honorary kitman Kalid (ku230) cc’d for more details!
<br><br>
We welcome everyone regardless of playing ability; whether you are a seasoned veteran, an occasional player looking to rekindle your career or a total rookie, Darwin College FC is the place for you! Sign up at the freshers’ fair or get in touch via Facebook or email, and be on the lookout for details of training and matches starting in October.

Reach out to us if you would like to drop in for a training/match and see if you like it!
<br><br>
Our team is a multi-college team that combines players from Darwin, St. Edmunds, and Wolfson (hence the commonly used abbreviation DEW FC). We regularly visit the grounds of all three colleges for trainings or socials, which is a great way to get to know these colleges and their members. We also have close ties to the Darwin men’s team and the two teams enjoy showing up to support each other at matches throughout the season.
<br><br>
We play in the inter-college women’s football league throughout Michaelmas, Lent, and Easter term in addition to the annual Cuppers tournament. We also have the occasional friendly match on weeks where a league game is not scheduled. Finally, throughout the summer, spontaneous kick-abouts keep us connected to each other and the sport!

<br><br> 
But DarGar is not just about growing - it's about eating too! In the summer months, you'll be able to pick your favourites or try new fruit / veg. In October we press the apples from the Darwin trees to make apple juice and cider. Over the winter we still meet up, often to make delicious dishes from food bought at the local farmers' market.

Darwin College Pool table Society DCPTS is one of the current societies of the College. The society has access to one pool table in the common room; it has 2 cues, one set of yellow and red balls (English balls), it also has equipment to change cue tips. The society also owns a box to keep the coins (50p) so the members do not have to pay for training. Training is mostly once a week but occasionally more. There is also a Facebook group which can be used by all members as well as other students who want to come and join the members, or those who get invited by members. The Facebook group has been an only way to get in touch with the members and let them know about the date and time of the training sessions as well as other activities. The society has ambitions to host a tournament for members and guests, though this may be Covid dependent. Furthermore, with enough members the society hopes to join the university league.

The Darwin College Running Club (DCRC) is a great community of people looking to enjoy the sights in and around Cambridge while enjoying fresh air and good company! We like to get out a few times a week for casual runs and tailor our regular sessions depending on the desires of the group. We encourage participation by runners of all abilities and often offer lead route variations to accommodate a variety of distances/paces. Typical runs during the week are around 5K while longer runs will happen on the weekend. Please get in contact with us if you would like to know more about our regular schedule and try out a run!
<br><br>
Members of our club often decide to try out one of the many annual races in Cambridge such as the Town & Gown 10K, Cambridge Half Marathon, the Boundary Run Half/Full Marathon, or the Chariots of Fire Relay. In the past we have also represented at races in London and beyond. As a club, we set up sessions so that we can train together towards these ambitious goals.

Darwin does Yoga!
<br><br>
We offer Iyengar yoga classes twice a week with one of Cambridge's most sought-after teachers, Shaili Shafai. All levels are welcome! We run classes twice a week during the whole year: Wednesdays 6-7pm and Saturdays 2:30-3:30pm. These usually happen in the common room, but to keep it safe and ensure social distancing, we have now moved online! You can join our online classes by subscribing to our  "Darwin College Yoga" mailing list to receive the class access details.
<br><br>
We offer all the equipment needed, so if you would like to access some of it to join our online yoga classes, get in touch.
<br><br>
We also offer more advanced workshops and social events once a term!
<br><br>
Find us on Facebook for more information.

<!-- NB: insert image -->

We run one Zumba class per week at Darwin, rotating every other week between traditional Zumba and STRONG. The former is a fitness program that combines Latin and international music with dance moves. Zumba routines incorporate interval training—alternating fast and slow rhythms—and resistance training.
<br><br>
STRONG classes combine a killer bodyweight bootcamp workout with party vibes and pumped-up music. It is a High Intensity Interval Training class using more traditional fitness moves for a more athletic, conditioningstyle workout. You use your own body weight as resistance to achieve muscle definition. The songs match every move, driving the intensity in a challenging progression that provides a total body workout.

Being a postgraduate college, a significant portion of our students arrive with their families. Darwin's Families Society aims to bring together students and families to form a joint community where all are welcomed, as well as promote family issues within the College and the University. We run informal events throughout the year as well as bigger events about once per term, to celebrate special occasions. Our most popular events are a Christmas (and Hanukkah) mulled wine and sing-along event held together with the Darwin choir, and the Easter egg hunt held in the College garden. In addition, the Families Society provides activities for children alongside the College-wide DCSA events, to ensure that all our College community feel welcome at all events wherever possible. The Society owns a number of toys and games for a range of different ages which members can access to help their children have a good time while at College. We encourage students with families and all students that want to be a part of this special community to join our society.

Mind Matters Darwin wants to raise awareness around mental health, end the stigma and promote wellbeing. We organize recreational activities fostering connections and wellbeing: movie screenings broadly related to mental health and get-togethers. We organise free-of-charge Meditation and Positive Psychology courses (in collaboration with Inner Space Cambridge), in order to improve resilience and alleviate psychological sufferance. We also organise a Mindfulness in Nature course with Claire Thompson, usually in the fall or in the spring, to connect with nature and enjoy the beauty of Darwin Garden and meditation practices. We run a Relationship Anarchy Support Circle once a month to provide a safe space to talk about alternative forms of relationships and ask for support.
<br><br>
We want Darwinians to feel safe and part of a community: it's time to consider the students' mental health and wellbeing as a priority. We want to improve communication and provide information about the many available resources in Cambridge for mental health support: everyone who is in need should feel free to ask for help and receive the necessary support.
<br><br>
We all have a mental health to take care of!

Darwinians do care about mental health!
