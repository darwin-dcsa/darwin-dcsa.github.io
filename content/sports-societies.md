<br><br>
Aerial Arts are a great way to improve strength, flexibility and overall fitness and the club is open to all students regardless of their age and experience-level. Whether you have previous experience or are just curious about it - please drop by at our sessions and give it a go! You can find out more by joining our Facebook group “Darwin College Aerial Arts” for regular updates.

Basketball has a long and successful tradition at Darwin. We participate every year in two Cambridge University inter-collegial competitions: Division 1 of the college league (Michaelmas and Lent terms) and the Cuppers (Easter term), of which we are the 2019 champions! The season kicks off late September and ends around April, but we continue to practice throughout the summer months. We are a friendly and active bunch and always welcome new players at varying skill levels in our teams. For more information get in touch with the team contacts or simply turn up at our practice session every Tuesday.

The Darwin Women’s Basketball Club is the college's most successful sports team having won the college league every year for the last 5 years and most years since its formation in May 2000. As well as the college league, the team ompetes in, and usually wins, the university-wide knock out 'Cuppers' tournament in Lent term. We are fortunate enough to have a dedicated basketball coach who runs our training from early October so we are ready for competitive matches throughout the year. Over the summer we continue to practice with friendly games every week, often joined by members of the university 1st and 2nd (Blues and Panthers) teams! The club is incredibly friendly and welcoming and is known for nurturing enthusiastic beginners. So if you want to come and play a sport that is both physically challenging and mentally stimulating please do join our training
sessions in October!

<!-- Boat Club -->
<details align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
  <summary><b>Boat Club </b></summary>

<!-- NB: insert image -->

Darwin College Boat Club (DCBC) is the largest society in Darwin. We are one of the most successful graduate boat clubs in Cambridge but above all, highly social and a very welcoming family. Rowing is hard to avoid in a place like Cambridge, it is a rich historical tradition and a quintessential part of the Cambridge experience. At DCBC we believe everyone should give it a go. 
<br><br>
Having just celebrated our 50th anniversary, we are a vibrant community which has been surging forward in the league over the past couple of years. While we train throughout the academic year (winter and summer) and participate in numerous races, including the main events of Lent Bumps (March) and May Bumps (June – don’t ask), we remain relaxed and don’t let competition get in the way of having fun. May Bumps s one of the highest-profile events on the Cambridge calendar (possibly the world, and that’s not an exaggeration!).
<br><br>
A somewhat peculiar tradition, bumps is held over 4 afternoons and involves a thrilling chase down a twisting section of the River Cam, with the aim of (physically) bumping the boat in front of you that you are chasing and avoiding being bumped by the crew behind you. The crowds are large and loud. Darwin has multiple boats participating in this event from the novice level to the senior level, ensuring maximum participation for as many of our members as possible (this is where being a smaller college is an advantage!).<br><br>
You can join at all levels of rowing from absolutely no idea what a boat looks like, you’ve maybe sat on a rowing machine at the gym, to having rowed at school or about to be selected for the Olympic rowing squad. You can join as a rower (person who dead lifts the water with a giant stick) or a cox (person in charge who sits on the throne at the stern, steers and shouts orders at the rowers).<br><br>
Whichever you choose, you will receive full coaching and training by the senior members of the club. Try a few random water sessions (aka “outings”) at the eginning of Michaelmas, and if you are interested in continuing, you’ll be placed in boats with other beginners, learn to row and cox together for the term, and become a boatful of unstoppable forces.
<br><br>
There will be opportunities to participate in fun sprint races against the other college boat club novice crews and then participate in the end of term Fairbairns Cup race, followed by the not-to-miss Boat Club Dinner, which is, generally speaking, absolutely flipping crazy.
<br><br>
Rowing is teamwork at its best. We cultivate strong tan lanes in the summer, deck ourselves out with matching kit, laugh together, sweat together, experience an exquisite kind of pain together. You will come away with some of the closest Darwin friendships and bonds that will be everlasting long after you leave Cambridge. Come and chat to us to find out more at the Fresher’s Sports and Societies Fair, and even get started and have a go on the rowing machine (aka “erg”)!

We are a group of climbers that simply just want to go climbing. Since there aren't many rocks around, we usually meet for an indoor bouldering session at one of the two gyms in town - Rainbow Rocket (RR) or Kelsey Kerridge (KK). We also make the occasional outdoor trip further north or abroad when the weather/season permits. We organise everything over WhatsApp or over a pint at Darbar, or check out what we are up to on Facebook ('Darwin Climbing Club'). We have bouldering mats, a trad rack, lots of quickdraws, a few spare harnesses, ropes, and belay devices which you can borrow for trips (indoor or outdoor).

We run one Zumba class per week at Darwin, rotating every other week between traditional Zumba and STRONG. The former is a fitness program that combines Latin and international music with dance moves. Zumba routines incorporate interval training—alternating fast and slow rhythms—and resistance training.
<br><br>
STRONG classes combine a killer bodyweight bootcamp workout with party vibes and pumped-up music. It is a High Intensity Interval Training class using more traditional fitness moves for a more athletic, conditioningstyle workout. You use your own body weight as resistance to achieve muscle definition. The songs match every move, driving the intensity in a challenging progression that provides a total body workout.

Being a postgraduate college, a significant portion of our students arrive
with their families. Darwin's Families Society aims to bring together students
and families to form a joint community where all are welcomed, as well as
promote family issues within the College and the University. We run informal
events throughout the year as well as bigger events about once per term, to
celebrate special occasions. Our most popular events are a Christmas (and
Hanukkah) mulled wine and sing-along event held together with the Darwin
choir, and the Easter egg hunt held in the College garden. In addition, the Families Society provides activities for children alongside the College-wide DCSA events, to ensure that all our College community feel welcome at all events wherever possible. The Society owns a number of toys and games for a range of different ages which members can access to help their children have a good time while at College. We encourage students with families and all students that want to be a part of this special community to join our society.

See the <a href="{{site.baseurl | absolute_url}}/documents/booklet_families.pdf">families guide</a> for lots of useful information.

Mind Matters Darwin wants to raise awareness around mental health, end the stigma and promote wellbeing. We organize recreational activities fostering connections and wellbeing, like movie screenings broadly related to mental health, get-togethers, and courses. We offer a free-of-charge Meditation and Positive Psychology course (in collaboration with Inner Space Cambridge), in order to improve resilience and alleviate psychological sufferance. We also organize a Mindfulness in Nature course with Claire Thompson, usually in the fall or in the spring, to connect with nature and enjoy the beauty of the Darwin Gardens and meditation practices. We run a Relationship Anarchy Support
Circle once a month to provide a safe space to talk about alternative forms of
relationships and ask for support.
<br><br>
We want Darwinians to feel safe and part of a community: it's time to consider the students' mental health and wellbeing as a priority. We want to improve
communication and provide information about the many available resources in
Cambridge for mental health support: everyone who is in need should feel free
to ask for help and receive the necessary support.
<br><br>
We all have a mental health to take care of! Darwinians care about mental health!

  <summary><b>Music Society </b></summary>

<!-- NB: insert image -->

The Darwin College Music Society (DCMS) is here to help make your college life
musical. We host events throughout the year and provide facilities and support for music making and performance.
<br><br>
Every Wednesday we host casual Jam Sessions in the common room. Please come along, everyone is welcome, bring your instruments if you have them, or have a bang on one of our bongos – no talent required or expected! We also host Open Mics in DarBar throughout the year to give you a chance to share your talent in front of a crowd of friendly faces. To help you make music we can also
give you access to the treasure trove that is the Darwin College Bar Cellar. In there we have a drum kit, PA system, amps, music stands - all sorts of goodies that we want you to make use of, and if something’s not there, we have money to buy stuff too! The college also has the common room for use as a rehearsal space, and four pianos.
<br><br>
The university has a thriving gig scene and we want Darwin musicians to be a part of it. Our veteran house-band, the Galapagogos, is often found at Jams, Open Mics and BOPs, and can offer wise(ish) words on getting onto the BOP and May Ball circuit.
<br><br>
The society has the Darwin College Music Society Facebook page for discussion and events (below) and we also have an email list with updates nonFacebookers. Any questions whatsoever just contact us, or just grab us at one of the Jam Sessions – if you want to do something musical here, we want you to too!
<br><br>
For more information about accessing the College instruments and booking rooms for music practice, see the music page on the <a href="https://www.darwin.cam.ac.uk/music">College website</a> and the <a href="{{site.baseurl | absolute_url}}/facilities/">Music section of the facilities page</a>.

The idea is pretty simple: a room, some wine and a topic no one can agree on. The Darwin Open Club for Debate is an informal non-stuffy club, where Darwinians and other students from the University of Cambridge debate about controversial topics in an open setting with minimal intervention from a moderator.
<br><br>
We usually meet once a week, and try to schedule debates relevant to latest news. Join our Facebook group to keep up with our events, everybody is welcome to attend!

In addition to being able to take your friends and family out when they visit, membership also gives you the opportunity to sign up to special events such as the annual punt race, the outings to the Trinity and St John’s May Ball fireworks at night, and to see King‘s choir‘s singing on the river. You can ask at the porters‘ lodge to join.
