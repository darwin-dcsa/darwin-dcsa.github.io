<div class="societies--image-container">
<img src="{{site.baseurl | absolute_url}}/images/Societies/dcbc.jpg" alt="[Darwin College Boat Club]"/>
</div>

Darwin   College   Boat   Club   (DCBC)   is   the   largest    society    in    Darwin,    dedicated    to    all  things  rowing!  We  are  one  of  the  most  successful graduate boat clubs in Cambridge - just check out the blades in the bar for our previous   accomplishments!   We   are,   above   all,  a  friendly,  social,  and  welcoming  family.  Rowing   is   a   Cambridge   tradition,   and   it   is  almost  impossible  to  avoid  at  least  one  conversation about it during your time here. At  DCBC,  we  believe  that  everyone  should  have a go, and encourage anyone to come try out,  at  least  so  you  can  decipher  the  jargon  of   the   sport!   We   train   year-round   (winter   and  summer)  and  participate  in  numerous  races   both   in   Cambridge   and   outside   of   Cambridge. 
<br><br>
In   August   2024,   Darwin   was   invited   to   compete at an international Regatta in South Korea alongside world leading rowing teams. The   main   events   in   our   calendar   include   Lent (in March) and May (in June - don’t ask) Bumps.  May  Bumps  is  one  of  the  highest-profile  events  in  the  Cambridge  calendar,  with  thousands  of  people  lining  the  banks  over 4 afternoons to watch boats speed down the Cam, attempting to physically crash into one  another  (a  Bump),  while  avoiding  being  hit  by  the  crew  behind  (getting  bumped).  If  you’re not in a boat, you can get the second most enjoyment out of the days by sitting on the  banks  with  your  refreshments  of  choice,  and cheering Darwin to victory! 
<br><br>
We  are  fortunate  enough  to  enter  multiple  boats   into   each   Bumps   race,   so   join   up   to   experience   the   carnage   first-hand!   We   welcome  all  levels  of  rowing  -  from  those  who  don’t  know  what  a  boat  looks  like  or  have  never  used  a  rowing  machine  (erg),  to  future   Olympic   hopefuls,   and   anything   in   between.  We  hold  taster sessions for both rowers and coxes (person in the front  of the boat making the rowing  calls and steering the boat). Whichever you feel suits you, you’ll get full coaching and training by our senior club members and experienced coaches. 
<br><br>
Try a few water sessions (outings) at the beginning of Michaelmas, and with the other novice rowers, you’ll slowly become unstoppable forces of nature, ready to slay the competition out on the river. There are plenty of opportunities for novices to take part in racing in Michaelmas term where you will have the chance to dress-up and race against other colleges. Novice races are  fun and light-hearted, culminating the term with the not-to-be-missed Boat Club Dinner, a chance to regale the Club with your war stories from the term, and just blow off some steam. Rowing is teamwork at its peak. From our strong tan lines in the summer, our matching kit (free speed), the laughs, the sweat, and the shared exquisite  pain, you will come away with some of the closest Darwin  friendships and bonds that will be  everlasting. 
<br><br>
Come and chat to us to find out more at the Fresher’s  Sports  and  Societies  Fair,  and  even  get started and have a go on the erg!

<!-- NB: insert image -->

In 2021, the College has relaunched the college choir, meeting regularly each Tuesday at 1800 in the Bradfield Room. Our new  director, Francis  Knights, has put together a  wonderful  programme of very  accesible English Church Music spanning 900 years  and including pieces by Tallis,  Purcell and Charles Wood, and we would love more singers to join us! The choir is run by the college and not through the DCSA.The choir is open to individuals of all abilities and from throughout the Cambridge     community and the music is VERY accessible. You don't have to be a Darwin  member, so spouses, significant others, partners, and friends are all welcome. Our rehearsals are fun, rewarding, and take place in a very friendly, welcoming environment. Do come along to de-stress from the pressures of work and help support our emerging musical community.

We are a group of climbers that simply just want to go climbing. Since there aren't many rocks around we usually meet for an  indoor bouldering session at  one of the  two gyms in town - Rainbow Rocket (RR) or Kelsey Kerridge (KK). We also make the  occasional outdoor trip further north or abroad when the weather/season permits. We organise everything  over WhatsApp or over a pint  at  DarBar or check out  what we are up to on Facebook “Darwin College Climbing Club”.  We have  bouldering  mats, a trad  rack, lots of quickdraws, a few spare harnesses, ropes, and belay devices which you can borrow for trips (indoor or outdoor)

Being a postgraduate college, a significant portion of our students arrive with their families. Darwin's Families Society aims to bring together students and families to form a joint community where all are welcomed, as well as promote family issues within the College and the University. We run informal events throughout the year as well as bigger events about once per term, to celebrate special occasions. Our most popular events are a Christmas (and Hanukkah) mulled wine and sing-along event held together with the Darwin choir, and the Easter egg hunt held in the College garden. In addition, the Families Society provides activities for children alongside the College-wide DCSA events, to ensure that all our College community feel welcome at all events wherever possible. The Society owns a number of toys and games for a range of different ages which members can access to help their children have a good time while at College. We encourage students with families and all students that want to be a part of this special community to join our society.

Mind Matters Darwin wants to raise awareness around mental health, end the stigma and promote wellbeing. We organize recreational activities fostering connections and wellbeing: movie screenings broadly related to mental health and get-togethers. We organise free-of-charge Meditation and Positive Psychology courses (in collaboration with Inner Space Cambridge), in order to improve resilience and alleviate psychological sufferance. We also organise a Mindfulness in Nature course with Claire Thompson, usually in the fall or in the spring, to connect with nature and enjoy the beauty of Darwin Garden and meditation practices. We run a Relationship Anarchy Support Circle once a month to provide a safe space to talk about alternative forms of relationships and ask for support.
<br><br>
We want Darwinians to feel safe and part of a community: it's time to consider the students' mental health and wellbeing as a priority. We want to improve communication and provide information about the many available resources in Cambridge for mental health support: everyone who is in need should feel free to ask for help and receive the necessary support.
<br><br>
We all have a mental health to take care of!

Darwinians do care about mental health!

Darwin College Pool table Society DCPTS is one of the current societies of the College. The society has access to one pool table in the common room; it has 2 cues, one set of yellow and red balls (English balls), it also has equipment to change cue tips. The society also owns a box to keep the coins (50p) so the members do not have to pay for training. Training is mostly once a week but occasionally more. There is also a Facebook group which can be used by all members as well as other students who want to come and join the members, or those who get invited by members. The Facebook group has been an only way to get in touch with the members and let them know about the date and time of the training sessions as well as other activities. The society has ambitions to host a tournament for members and guests, though this may be Covid dependent. Furthermore, with enough members the society hopes to join the university league.

We run one Zumba class per week at Darwin, rotating every other week between traditional Zumba and STRONG. The former is a fitness program that combines Latin and international music with dance moves. Zumba routines incorporate interval training—alternating fast and slow rhythms—and resistance training.
<br><br>
STRONG classes combine a killer bodyweight bootcamp workout with party vibes and pumped-up music. It is a High Intensity Interval Training class using more traditional fitness moves for a more athletic, conditioningstyle workout. You use your own body weight as resistance to achieve muscle definition. The songs match every move, driving the intensity in a challenging progression that provides a total body workout.
