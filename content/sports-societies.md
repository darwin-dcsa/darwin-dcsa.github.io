Darwin College Badminton Club welcomes players of all standards, from complete beginners to experienced. We normally hold sessions on Saturday afternoons from 4 pm to 6 pm at Leys Leisure on Trumpington Road, but due to COVID-19, our weekly sessions have been temporarily suspended. We will keep you informed through our Facebook page (“Darwin College Badminton Club”) once we have decided when we will restart. We will ensure this happens as soon as possible. All of our sessions are completely free, there are no membership fees, and shuttles and rackets are provided. We are a friendly and active bunch so come say hi at the freshers’ clubs and societies fair, join our Facebook group, and feel free to get in touch if you have further questions.

Basketball has a long and successful tradition at Darwin. We participate every year in two Cambridge University intercollegial competitions: Division 1 of the college league (Michaelmas and Lent terms) and the Cuppers (Easter term), of which we are the defending champions since 2019! The season kicks off late September and ends around April, but we continue to practice throughout the summer months. We are a friendly and active bunch and always welcome new players at varying skill levels in our teams.
COVID-19: Practice sessions are currently suspended until further notice, and it is likely that the intercollegial competitions are cancelled for the 2020-21 academic year. We plan to resume practices as soon as it is safe to play. For more information and updates on the situation, get in touch with the team contacts.
<br><br>
Practice: Tuesday 8-10 pm at North Cambridge Academy

The Darwin Women’s Basketball Club is the college's most successful sports team having won the college league every year for the last 5 years and most years since its formation in May 2000. As well as the college league, the team ompetes in, and usually wins, the university-wide knock out 'Cuppers' tournament in Lent term. We are fortunate enough to have a dedicated basketball coach who runs our training from early October so we are ready for competitive matches throughout the year. Over the summer we continue to practice with friendly games every week, often joined by members of the university 1st and 2nd (Blues and Panthers) teams! The club is incredibly friendly and welcoming and is known for nurturing enthusiastic beginners. So if you want to come and play a sport that is both physically challenging and mentally stimulating please do join our training
sessions in October!

Having BEEn lured in by the sweet idea of collecting our very own honey, the Darwin College Beekeeping Association started our very own DarHives in the Darwin Garden. We learn about and discuss all aspects of beekeeping, but promise not to drone on about it, and welcome new members at any experience level as long as you have a high threshold for bee puns. So, if you are an eco-warrior keen to join the fight against our declining pollinators or just looking for an exciting new hobby, email or join us on a hive visit to find out what all the buzz is about!

<!-- Boat Club -->
<details align="justify" style="text-align:justify">
  <summary><b>Boat Club </b></summary>

<!-- NB: insert image -->

Darwin College Boat Club (DCBC) is the largest society in Darwin, dedicated to all things rowing! We are one of the most successful graduate boat clubs in Cambridge - just check out the blades in the bar for our previous accomplishments! We are, above all, a friendly, social, and welcoming family. Rowing is a Cambridge tradition, and it is almost impossible to avoid at least one conversation about it during your time here. At DCBC, we believe that everyone should have a go, and encourage anyone to come try out, at least so you can decipher the jargon of the sport!
<br><br>
We train year-round (winter and summer), and participate in numerous races, including the main events of Lent (March) and May (June - don’t ask) Bumps. Mays are one of the highest-profile events in the Cambridge calendar, with thousands of people lining the banks over 4 afternoons to watch boats speed down the Cam, attempting to physically crash into one another (a Bump), while avoiding being hit by the crew behind (getting bumped). If you’re not in a boat, you can get the second most enjoyment out of the days by sitting on the banks with your refreshments of choice, and cheering Darwin to victory! We are fortunate enough to enter multiple boats into each Bumps race, so join up to experience the carnage first hand!
<br><br>
We welcome all levels of rowing, from those who don’t know what a boat looks like, to anyone who’s ever tried the rowing machine (erg) at the gym, to future Olympic hopefuls, and anything in between. We hold taster sessions for both rowers (all on the legs, deadlift the water to go fast) or coxes (loud and in charge, does everything else in the boat). Whichever you feel suits you, you’ll get full coaching and training by our senior club members and experienced coaches. Try a few water sessions (outings) at the beginning of Michaelmas, and with the other novice rowers, you’ll slowly become unstoppable forces of nature, ready to slay the competition out on the river. During Michaelmas, there are typically novice races where you can compete against other colleges (including one in fancy dress), culminating the term with the not-to-be-missed Boat Club Dinner, a chance to regale the Club with your war stories from the term, and just blow off some steam.
<br><br>
The DCBC Committee is working tirelessly to ensure that we will be able to continue with rowing given the current COVID-19 situation. If you have any concerns, we are happy to discuss our process and commitments to safety with you.
<br><br>
Rowing is teamwork at its peak. From our strong tan lines in the summer, our matching kit (free speed), the laughs, the sweat, and the shared exquisite pain, you will come away with some of the closest Darwin friendships and bonds that will be everlasting. Come and chat to us to find out more at the Fresher’s Sports and Societies Fair, and even get started and have a go on the erg!

We are a group of climbers that simply just want to go climbing. Since there aren't many rocks around we usually meet for an indoor bouldering session at one of the two gyms in town - Rainbow Rocket (RR) or Kelsey Kerridge (KK). We also make the occasional outdoor trip further north or abroad when the weather/season permits. We organise everything over Whatsapp or over a pint at DarBar or check out what we are up to on Facebook. We have bouldering mats, a trad rack, lots of quickdraws, a few spare harnesses, ropes, and belay devices which you can borrow for trips (indoor or outdoor).

Drink and Draw is a casual arts and crafts society of the college. Everybody is welcomed, especially those traumatised by school art classes. We mostly meet up in DarBar to doodle and gossip together, but we also organise occasional day-time workshops. The point is to enjoy the process and do something with our hands after stressful days at labs/libraries/behind monitors. Artistic worth and ambition is passively discouraged, but tolerated. Normally we would meet in Darbar between 9pm and 12pm every Wednesday, but until we can meet indoors again, we will be bringing our drinks and art supplies to the Darwin gardens or make trips out around Cambridge - follow our Facebook page for updates (“DarwinDrinkAndDraw”) or email us.

DarGar is the Darwin College student vegetable garden. This little green oasis is cultivated by Darwin college members, usually meeting every Sunday at 4pm. Whether you're a seasoned gardener or a complete beginner, you're welcome to join us in cultivating flowers, vegetables, herbs, and fruit! 
<br><br> 
But DarGar is not just about growing - it's about eating too! In the summer months, you'll be able to pick your favourites or try new fruit / veg. In October we press the apples from the Darwin trees to make apple juice and cider. Over the winter we still meet up, often to make delicious dishes from food bought at the local farmers' market.

Darwin's LGBTQ+ community has regular meet-ups where we do an assortment of activities like arts & crafts, but most often just a simple chat with your friends with drinks and snacks provided. The 'Darwin community only' events are intercalated with social swaps with communities from nearby colleges (bar nights, BBQs).

February is Cambridge's LGBTQ+ history month, with plenty of talks and events (like formal halls, bar crawls and club nights) organised by the Cambridge University Students' Union (join their <a href="https://lists.cam.ac.uk/

The Darwin College Music Society (DCMS) is here to help make your college life musical. We host events throughout the year and provide facilities and support for music making and performance.
<br><br>
Every Wednesday we usually host casual Jam Sessions in the common room. These are currently on COVID induced hiatus, but hopefully will be back soon! We also host Open Mics in College throughout the year to give you a chance to share your talent in front of a crowd of friendly faces.
<br><br>
To help you make music we can also give you access to the treasure trove that is the Darwin College Bar Cellar. In there we have a drum kit, PA system, amps, music stands - all sorts of goodies that we want you to make use of, and if something’s not there, we have money to buy stuff too! The college also has the common room for use as a rehearsal space, and various pianos dotted around, all to be taken advantage of.
<br><br>
For more information about accessing the College instruments and booking rooms for music practice, see the music page on the <a href="https://www.darwin.cam.ac.uk/music">College website</a> and the <a href="{{site.baseurl | absolute_url}}/facilities/">Music section of the facilities page</a>.

Darwin College Pool table Society DCPTS is one of the current societies of the College. The society has access to one pool table in the common room; it has 2 cues, one set of yellow and red balls (English balls), it also has equipment to change cue tips. The society also owns a box to keep the coins (50p) so the members do not have to pay for training. Training is mostly once a week but occasionally more. There is also a Facebook group which can be used by all members as well as other students who want to come and join the members, or those who get invited by members. The Facebook group has been an only way to get in touch with the members and let them know about the date and time of the training sessions as well as other activities. The society has ambitions to host a tournament for members and guests, though this may be Covid dependent. Furthermore, with enough members the society hopes to join the university league.

Darwin does Yoga!
<br><br>
We offer Iyengar yoga classes twice a week with one of Cambridge's most sought-after teachers, Shaili Shafai. All levels are welcome! We run classes twice a week during the whole year: Wednesdays 6-7pm and Saturdays 2:30-3:30pm. These usually happen in the common room, but to keep it safe and ensure social distancing, we have now moved online! You can join our online classes by subscribing to our  "Darwin College Yoga" mailing list to receive the class access details.
<br><br>
We offer all the equipment needed, so if you would like to access some of it to join our online yoga classes, get in touch.
<br><br>
We also offer more advanced workshops and social events once a term!
<br><br>

  <summary><b>Zumba </b></summary>

<!-- NB: insert image -->

We run one Zumba class per week at Darwin, rotating every other week between traditional Zumba and STRONG. The former is a fitness program that combines Latin and international music with dance moves. Zumba routines incorporate interval training—alternating fast and slow rhythms—and resistance training.
<br><br>
STRONG classes combine a killer bodyweight bootcamp workout with party vibes and pumped-up music. It is a High Intensity Interval Training class using more traditional fitness moves for a more athletic, conditioningstyle workout. You use your own body weight as resistance to achieve muscle definition. The songs match every move, driving the intensity in a challenging progression that provides a total body workout.

Being a postgraduate college, a significant portion of our students arrive with their families. Darwin's Families Society aims to bring together students and families to form a joint community where all are welcomed, as well as promote family issues within the College and the University. We run informal events throughout the year as well as bigger events about once per term, to celebrate special occasions. Our most popular events are a Christmas (and Hanukkah) mulled wine and sing-along event held together with the Darwin choir, and the Easter egg hunt held in the College garden. In addition, the Families Society provides activities for children alongside the College-wide DCSA events, to ensure that all our College community feel welcome at all events wherever possible. The Society owns a number of toys and games for a range of different ages which members can access to help their children have a good time while at College. We encourage students with families and all students that want to be a part of this special community to join our society.

Mind Matters Darwin wants to raise awareness around mental health, end the stigma and promote wellbeing. We organize recreational activities fostering connections and wellbeing: movie screenings broadly related to mental health and get-togethers. We organise free-of-charge Meditation and Positive Psychology courses (in collaboration with Inner Space Cambridge), in order to improve resilience and alleviate psychological sufferance. We also organise a Mindfulness in Nature course with Claire Thompson, usually in the fall or in the spring, to connect with nature and enjoy the beauty of Darwin Garden and meditation practices. We run a Relationship Anarchy Support Circle once a month to provide a safe space to talk about alternative forms of relationships and ask for support.
<br><br>
We want Darwinians to feel safe and part of a community: it's time to consider the students' mental health and wellbeing as a priority. We want to improve communication and provide information about the many available resources in Cambridge for mental health support: everyone who is in need should feel free to ask for help and receive the necessary support.
<br><br>
We all have a mental health to take care of!

Darwinians do care about mental health!
